Welcome to the Anchorage API documentation!

# Introduction
Anchorage is a Python library and CLI to bulk archive your bookmark collection easily and
without friction. It allows you to retrieve your bookmark collection from your browser of 
choice, filter out duplicates, local files and entries matching string, substring and regex 
searches, and archive the whole thing: online in [The Internet Archive](https://archive.org/) 
or locally, using [ArchiveBox](https://archivebox.io/).
